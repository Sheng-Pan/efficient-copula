This repository provides MATLAB codes for robust estimation of Value at Risk (VaR) and tail dependence using copula models, focusing on estimator performance under copula misspecification. The codes employ Monte Carlo simulations, k-fold cross-validation, and numerical integration to analyze copula-based financial risk measures. Simulations compare the variance and mean squared error (MSE) of rank-based estimation methods, including non-parametric approaches, semiparametric one-step(OSE) and K-step estimators for enhanced efficiency, and pseudo-likelihood estimators (PLE).

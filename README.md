# efficient-copula
This repository contains MATLAB codes for robust estimation of Value at Risk (VaR) and tail dependence using copula models, with an emphasis on evaluating estimator performance under copula misspecification. The codes implement Monte Carlo simulations, k-fold cross-validation, and numerical integration techniques to analyze copula-based financial risk measures. The simulation.m compare the variance and mean squared error (MSE) of various rank-based estimation methods, including non-parametric, one-step estimators (OSE), and pseudo-likelihood estimators (PLE).
